# Repo2book
Converts a git repository code base into a PDF-ready latex file.

# Requirements
For Latex Generation - None

For PDF Generation I used MiKTex with following packages installed:
- listings
- inconsolata

There could be something more, but MiKTex prompts you for missing packages so who cares.
